							<p>I've always like the way people treat their guest. i mean they are just there letting you do your stuff and 
							from time to time checking if everthings ok. If you need them they wont 
							hesitate to extend assistance. If you have questions they will answer or 
							if they didnt know they always direct you to the person who can answer it
							... which works well for some people like me.</p>

							<p>I called to make sure they accommodated me,a Charter Member from Glorietta.
							Since i would be joining Lloyd's class and my friend Alex was doing team 
							teaching,the people from New Manila were glad enough to make sure I was 
							not hassled. They were extremely nice( even remembering my active participation 
							in dance ggx classes before in other Gold's Gym branches.) 
							Thank you and more power to the Gold's Gym staff in New Manila</p>

							<p>It's my second home. Some trainers are very friendly and accomodating, willing to assist me, 
							coach me, give me advice and monitor my progress, I can not ask for more.
							They out weight the negative comments other clients posted</p>
